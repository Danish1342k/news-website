-- This script helps you create the admin user
-- You'll need to run this in your Supabase SQL editor after creating the user in Auth

-- Note: The actual user creation must be done through Supabase Auth UI or API
-- This is just a reference for the email that should be used

-- The admin user should have:
-- Email: admin@example.com
-- Password: admin123 (or your preferred password)
-- Email confirmed: true

-- You can also create the user programmatically using Supabase's admin API
-- but for simplicity, use the Supabase dashboard UI
